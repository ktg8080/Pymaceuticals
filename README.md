# Pymaceuticals

249 mice who were identifed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors, received treatment with a range of drug regimens over the course of 45 days. 
Over the 45 days, tumor developement was observed and measured. The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals's drug interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens. 
The data does show the statistical summary of the drug treaments. The observed timepoints for all drug regimens, as well as the breakdown of male to female mice in the study. 
The data also shows the final tumor volume at the last treatment timepoint across four of the drug treaments. This includes graphical analysis using box plots and outliers. 
A line chart is also provided showing the tumor volume across the treament of a specific mouse on Capomulin. There is also a scatter plot and regression model between the weight of the mouse and the average tumor volume.
